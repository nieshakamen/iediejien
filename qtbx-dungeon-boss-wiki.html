Hey, I'm curious about something here. I was grinding Beiorg Castle and I got the boss down to 0 HP, it didn't seem to try to revive and after guarding with everybody it self destructed. Took two turns to beat it. I guess what I'm trying to ask is, is killing the Beiorg Boss as easy as just guarding or was I lucky? Edit: Wiki is fixed. But now for something that I found a little interesting. I'm playing BF on Windows and the Beiorg Castle boss isn't recovering I tried one, once. I didn't know what I was doing, and I know like nothing about them, but the entire dungeon just felt strange and meaningless. I've heard you can get cool stuff in them, though, so I wanna get into them. How do they work? How are they categorized? What are glyphs? How do I make the dungeons amazing? How do I know what cool stuff each one has? How necessary are they? If I don't have PS+, can I still use dungeons made by other people? I'm kinda sad that I didn't have the time and discipline to experience how Terriaria feels when you don't spoil yourself through the Wiki and instead discover everything completely by yourself. Has anyone here done that, especially past version 1.2 or even 1.3? How was the experience. Hi FFRK community! I was thinking of slowly revising the subreddit's wiki (https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/wiki/index/misc_archives), since there's a lot of outdated information, discontinued pages, dead links, etc., but I wanted to get some feedback before making some major changes. What information do you still find useful on the wiki? A lot of the pages have information that I feel is better covered by Enlir's Database and other resources these days. I'm thinking of archiving. Hello everyone! I am SaltyJayyy and I love playing a large variety of games, Hence gna jump right back into Terraria, a game I played about 2 years ago. Even though i've played it 2 years ago, I was still very new to the game and was unsure of alot of stuff. I managed to make it to hard mode, but was struggling because I might've not done certain procedures to make it easier. (or at least thats what I think). I'm here today to ask if there I haven't played FFXIV for almost a year due to classes, work, and family keeping me busy. So when I finally have the opportunity to rejoin the game, I typically lean toward playing one of my favorite roles: Tank. Unfortunately, this means that I have to be familiar with the mechanics of so many different bosses from Dungeons and Trials that I'm forced to delay my group and either ask for an explanation, or look up the strategy on the wiki. So I'm curious if there exists a guide out there. Just bought the game and really enjoying so far! I am wondering I haven't encountered a boss yet and I just keep on digging and looking for ores. Am I missing something or do I have a MUST-DO for beginners? Thanks.

Got all 3 endings and beat all optional bosses already so I don't see a point. Chalice dungeons are what I'm doing right now for fun so I was just wondering. Hi, first off I'd like to say that I tried searching both google and reddit, and the results were either confusing or outdated. I'd just like to upgrade 2 items to +9 so I'd need about 24. I heard / read that an Iza Chalice is the best and yields 3 per run, but Imm not really sure how the chalice dungeons work yet and idk if this was outdated 
I played GW1 for years and loved it so I immediately bought GW2 I had it pre-ordered and everything. I loved the ideas of the new combat style and for a couple weeks I played the shit out of it. Then I kinda put it down, from time to time I would play, but it became clear it wasn't the addictive game I loved with GW1. I thought a lot about what could be causing that and I realized that I can't play it alone like I could in GW1, you don't have heros to run around with, and farming isn't a thing. Dear Ladies and Gentleman of the Guild Wars 2 subreddit, I have played the game for 2-3 months following the launch, but the then present end game model could not keep me hooked. I have recently reinstalled the game and found that I still enjoy the gameplay. My question would be, is there a real PvE endgame right now and whether or not the expansion is worth the investment? Thank you PS.: Are Mesmers decent nowadays. I am starting to get into the difficulty 70's for story mode at around 115 stamina. I heard that intimidate makes any boss that it can work on simple as they do nothing, but im taking it into fights and finding most dont work. Is there a list where someone has put if it works or not? Thanks. It's so different from minecraft! We got it while it was on sale for two bucks and im loving it so much so far! The Eye of Cthulu randomly spawned on us and we just beat it, what do we do now? Is there like a walkthrough or beginners guide. </p>
